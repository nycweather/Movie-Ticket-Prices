# Movie Ticket Prices Analysis
## Here we will explores data from popular movie rating websites and shows whether Fandango plumps up its movie reviews to sell more movie tickets
### *This project uses jupyter notebook enviroment to explore gather data from [Fandango](https://www.fandango.com/) and [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). Where we will compare and contrast the discrepancy between Fandangos movie ratings vs the actual user ratings of the movies and see if Fandango inflates said ratings.*
----------
## Thoughts for this project
### *This project was previously done by [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) where they find the conclusion that Fandango infact did inflate its movie ratings, and this project verifies and visualizes the skewed ratings presented by Fandango.*
-----------
## Reasons for this project
- Create custom visualization that tells a story
- Normalize data to present a clear conclusion
- Copy another project but do it accurately enough to match previous conclusion

## Conclusion

## When we take a look at the difference of scores from each movie comparing Fandango's Stars rating agaist its actual inhouse rating we can see that most of the movies already have a rounded up rating and some are inflated beyond their floor values.
